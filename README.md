# Cisual-AI-and-Computer-Vision
- Video and Image data collection for applying already trained models from youtube, twitch, scraping from stock footage etc
- Applying vision models for segmentation, classification, object detection, VQA, captioning, and image processing techniques (openCV, PIL, etc). No need to train new models, no knowledge of data science or data analysis or traditional machine learning required. Only skill important here is how to find great images and videos to apply already existing and trained models to accomplish solving some vision problem
- need good prompting skills and knowlege of RAG, embeddings, and general GENAI knowledge to integrate GPT, claude, etc LLMS, VLMs through API.
- Need average softwae engineering skills to assemble all these components into an end-to-end web application running for a subset of data (doesn't need to run in real-time or on edge devices, deployment won't be necessay)
- Bonus if comfortable developing simple UI stuff using Strealit and possibly using react/nextjs

Application E.g., parking lot management, Video analysis, Extraction of knowledge from images, manufacturing detect analysis, Agentic Object Detection, and Safety Gear analysis.
------------
To create a solution that applies pre-trained models for tasks like image segmentation, classification, object detection, Visual Question Answering (VQA), captioning, and image processing techniques, you’ll need to focus on collecting video and image data, applying these models, and integrating relevant tools such as OpenCV, PIL, and large language models (LLMs) like GPT for advanced queries.

Given your description, you’re looking for a web application that uses pre-trained vision models for analysis and integrates with GPT-based models for textual reasoning over images/videos. I will provide a structured approach, broken down into modules to make it easier to understand and implement.
High-Level Architecture:

    Data Collection: Gather video and image data from YouTube, Twitch, stock footage, and other sources using scraping or APIs.
    Pre-processing: Apply necessary image/video processing techniques using OpenCV, PIL, and other libraries.
    Model Application: Apply pre-trained models (like object detection, image segmentation, etc.).
    Textual Interaction: Use GPT/Claude-based models for providing answers or generating captions from images and video.
    Web Application: Assemble everything into a simple web interface using Streamlit and optionally React/Next.js for advanced UI.

Step-by-Step Python Code Implementation
1. Data Collection from YouTube and Twitch (Using APIs)

To collect data from YouTube and Twitch, you can use their APIs. You’ll need to set up API keys and use their respective Python libraries.
YouTube API Example:

pip install google-api-python-client

from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import os

# Set up YouTube API client
api_key = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY'
youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)

def get_video_data(query, max_results=5):
    request = youtube.search().list(
        q=query,
        part='snippet',
        type='video',
        maxResults=max_results
    )
    response = request.execute()

    video_urls = []
    for item in response['items']:
        video_urls.append(f"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={item['id']['videoId']}")
    
    return video_urls

# Example usage: Get video URLs for the query "safety gear"
video_urls = get_video_data("safety gear")
print(video_urls)

Twitch API Example:

pip install twitchAPI

from twitchAPI.twitch import Twitch

# Initialize Twitch API client
twitch = Twitch('CLIENT_ID', 'CLIENT_SECRET')

def get_twitch_videos(query, max_results=5):
    videos = twitch.search_videos(query, first=max_results)
    video_urls = [video['url'] for video in videos['data']]
    return video_urls

# Example usage: Get Twitch video URLs for the query "manufacturing analysis"
twitch_video_urls = get_twitch_videos("manufacturing analysis")
print(twitch_video_urls)

2. Preprocessing Video/Images for Vision Models

Once you have the video and image data, you can process them using libraries like OpenCV and PIL for tasks like resizing, frame extraction, etc.
Image Preprocessing with OpenCV and PIL:

pip install opencv-python pillow

import cv2
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Function to preprocess image using OpenCV
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img_resized = cv2.resize(img, (224, 224))  # Resize for model compatibility
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img_resized, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)  # Convert to RGB
    return img_rgb

# Convert image to PIL for further processing or saving
def save_pil_image(image_array, save_path):
    pil_image = Image.fromarray(image_array)
    pil_image.save(save_path)

# Example usage
image = preprocess_image('path_to_image.jpg')
save_pil_image(image, 'processed_image.jpg')

3. Apply Pre-Trained Vision Models (Object Detection, Image Segmentation, etc.)

You can use popular pre-trained models like those from Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub. Let’s use a pre-trained object detection model as an example.
Object Detection Example Using Hugging Face and Transformers:

pip install transformers torch torchvision

from transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection
import torch
import requests
from PIL import Image

# Load a pre-trained DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model
processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")

def detect_objects(image_path):
    # Load and preprocess image
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    
    # Perform object detection
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    target_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])  # [height, width]
    results = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.9)[0]

    # Print detected objects
    for score, label in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"]):
        print(f"Detected object: {label.item()}, Score: {score.item()}")
    
    return results

# Example usage
results = detect_objects('processed_image.jpg')

4. Integrating GPT/Claude for Text Generation (VQA, Captioning)

Once you have your image/video processed, you can use a language model (GPT or Claude) to generate captions or perform VQA tasks. For this, you can use the OpenAI GPT API or Claude API.
Example: VQA with GPT-3

pip install openai

import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

def ask_question_about_image(image_path, question):
    image_description = "A description of the image might go here."
    
    prompt = f"Given this description of the image: '{image_description}', answer the following question: {question}"

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )

    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
answer = ask_question_about_image('processed_image.jpg', "What objects are in the image?")
print(answer)

5. Creating the Web Application (Streamlit)

Finally, we can assemble everything into a simple Streamlit web application to interact with users, upload images, and run the vision models.
Streamlit Application Example:

pip install streamlit

import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
from transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection
import torch

# Initialize the model
processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")

def detect_objects(image):
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    target_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])
    results = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.9)[0]
    return results

# Streamlit app
st.title("AI-Powered Image and Video Analysis")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload an image", type=["jpg", "png", "jpeg"])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    image = Image.open(uploaded_file)
    st.image(image, caption="Uploaded Image", use_column_width=True)
    
    results = detect_objects(image)
    st.write("Detected objects:")
    for score, label in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"]):
        st.write(f"Object: {label.item()}, Confidence: {score.item():.2f}")

# Run Streamlit app with `streamlit run <filename>.py`

6. Optional: Advanced UI with React/Next.js

If you'd like to extend this with a React/Next.js frontend, you can make API calls to the backend (where the Python-based image/video processing is done) using fetch or axios.

Here’s a simple approach to get started with React/Next.js:

    Set up a Next.js app.
    Create endpoints in Next.js to handle image uploads and interact with the Python backend (Flask or FastAPI can be used).
    Use fetch or axios to send requests to the backend to process images and display results.

Conclusion:

In this project, you’re applying pre-trained models for computer vision tasks, integrating with language models for VQA or captioning, and building a web application. You’ll be gathering video/image data from sources like YouTube and Twitch, processing it with vision models, and then displaying the results on a web app (using Streamlit or React). You can extend this setup with more advanced features like real-time video analysis or integrating additional pre-trained models.
